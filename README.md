# WheelReductionDrive

A very simple mod for Kerbal Space Program allowing you to add a reductor to
any motorized wheel. You can have higher speed with lower torque and lower
speed with higher torque. Reductor ratio currently limited between 0.3 to 3.0.
You can also increase wheel endurance with the cost of extra mass.

Wheel cost also increased - each modifier adds standard wheel cost.
